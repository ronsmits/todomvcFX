TodoMVC-JavaFX is a collection of different implementations of the same JavaFX application. It aims to provide examples with different design patterns, frameworks, programming languages and programming styles. 

It's inspired by the famous [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) project which is doing the same thing for JavaScript/Web frameworks. 

By implementing the same use cases with different approaches we hope to provide several benefits:

- find out which different approaches and frameworks are out there
- compare different frameworks
- learn how to setup a small application with a specific framework and use it as basic project skeleton
- bring JavaFX community together and discuss the various approaches
